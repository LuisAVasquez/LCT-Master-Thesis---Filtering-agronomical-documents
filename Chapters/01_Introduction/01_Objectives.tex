 Our objective is to leverage \gls{ai} to support the Plant Health Monitoring efforts of the \gls{pesv} Platform.


 The primary objective of this project is to facilitate and enhance the monitoring of Plant Health at the \gls{pesv} Platform by introducing a degree of automation to the traditionally manual processes. 
 Recognizing the critical importance of timely and accurate Plant Health monitoring, our aim is to harness the data provided to us by experts at the \gls{vsi} team in order to develop a detection system based on \gls{ai}. By doing so, we aspire to offer a more efficient, data-driven approach to detect early signs of plant diseases, pests, or any other anomalies. 
 This would not only ensure a faster response and intervention but also alleviates the workload of professionals in the field. This endeavor is not merely about replacing human intervention but assisting it. By automating certain repetitive and time-consuming tasks, we aim to alleviate experts to focus on more nuanced and complex aspects of plant health, ensuring that their expertise is utilized where it is most needed.
