\customHeader{0}{The \VSI{} Dataset}
\label{vsi_dataset}


Within this \headerName{}, we provide a detailed description of the \gls{vsi} Dataset.
As mentioned in \headerName{} \ref{01_pesv_platform}, the \gls{pesv} Platform collects information on risks to Plant Health or events that could potentially affect agriculture. The \gls{vsi} experts achieve this by surveying online documents, which they subsequently screen and collect into the \gls{vsi} dataset.
