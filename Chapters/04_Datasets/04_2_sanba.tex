\label{04_sanba_dataset}


RB sez:
The Sanba dataset is collected from a complex query on WoS that attemps to capture the project subject (livestock health x wellbeing). The title and abstract, and sometimes the full text, has been exmamined and judged by a single senior researcher (Belen Barrio).

Some basic stats: # docs, # positive.

Some facts: cleaner.

Some remarks: the goal is to detect the relevance on an emerging subject. Consequently not that wxell defined. Very hard task.
