In the field of Plant Health Epidemiological Surveillance, accurately analyzing written reports of events affecting agriculture is crucial. This master's thesis in Natural Language Processing leverages the power of Automatic \textclassification{}, specifically focusing on its application in monitoring plant health. Conducted as part of the \emph{TIERS-ESV} project, this work is a joint effort between the \bibliome{} team at the \INRAE{} MaIAGE Laboratory and the \VSI{} team at the \PESV{} Plant Health Surveillance Platform. 
Central to our research is a dataset curated and annotated by the \VSI{} team, consisting of reports extracted from online sources.
This diverse, multilingual dataset was subjected to thorough preprocessing, applying methods for noise elimination, error message removal, and addressing scrapping errors and annotation discrepancies.
We employed various \BERT{} models for \textclassification{}, tailored to our dataset via \finetuning{} and pattern-based training method.
After extensive classifier training, we selected the top-performing models. 
The efficacy of the models obtained as a result of this work will result in the deployment of \BERT{}-based classifiers, poised to assist the \VSI{} experts in their monitoring mission.
