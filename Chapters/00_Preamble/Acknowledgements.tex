Starting this Master's degree has been a great personal step. Moving abroad and really learning about other cultures is a both an opportunity and a challenge. Facing completely different expectations around social norms, education, and bureaucracy has been a test. 


I appreciate everyone that supported me during this journey, especially, I would like to thank, ordered by name length and then alphabetically, Anna, Flor, Diego, Elisa, Mar\'ia, Shane, Isabel, Joanna, Karolin, Maxime, William, and Luis Felipe. 
Additional thanks go to the LCT students and people that made our time more enjoyable.

I also thank my supervisors for the helpful discussions and support they offered me for this thesis, and the Saclay-IA platform for the computational resources provided.

Finally, I would like to acknowledge the LCT Consortium for putting together this Erasmus Mundus Master Program, and especially for the scholarship I received, without which, pursuing this degree would not have been feasible.
